# Python Exercises
Welcome to my repository of Python exercises! Here you will find a collection of basic algorithms and concepts in Python that I am learning and practicing.

## Introduction
Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and many other applications. It has a simple syntax and is easy to learn for beginners.
This repository contains exercises that cover fundamental concepts in Python, such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming. By completing these exercises, you can gain a deeper understanding of these concepts and improve your problem-solving skills.
